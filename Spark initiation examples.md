## Oath of the Quester
In the temple of Justicars, young knights may take the Oath of the Quester and swear to serve the church for life. This oath is irrevocable by the law of the land, and marks any Knight as an active agent of the Church until they die. This has sometimes inspired the spark to light up. 

The knights do not know what a spark is, of course, but they know of Stalla's Blessing! Some take the oath specifically hoping that the spark, or "blessing", will come to them, but for such young knights it usually doesn't.

Instead, the knights that truly make the oath out of a desire to be a Holy Quester for life regularly light their spark in the moment of inspiration when they take their Oath. They are said to be blessed by Stalla, and these few knights are called Paladins.

## A Village in Flames
In the outer regions of the Goldspiran plains there lies a village called Shimmerleaf. This village is ablaze, as bandits have torched the place and are currently rounding up villagers for slavery. 

A young lad prays that the stories of the Heroes are true. For all his childhood, his parents have told him stories of the Heroes of Goldspire, who would find a fire in their heart and get special powers for their bravery. He takes up a kitchen knife and storms the bandit leader, imagining that his Heroic story starts here!

It doesn't. The lad hadn't committed to attacking the bandits with his own power, instead praying for special powers to win the day for him... He falls to the blade.

His mother's mind goes blank, and the animalistic fury of vengeance blinds her as she charges that same bandit leader. As her spark lights up, her hand changes and morphs into wicked claws. Her legs grow and mutate. With inhuman power, she leaps at the bandits, tearing their leader's throat out with her unnaturally clawed hand. She turns to rip and tear into the now fleeing bandits.

## The Mission of Eccothief
In a town near the metropolis of Solevidom, a young man works diligently, installing a new winch in a well. Then an army of mighty demons invade, slaughtering all in their path. The mighty warlord from Hell, wielding a wicked blade stabs the young man in the chest. In the moment the young man should have died, he instead enters a trance far removed from reality.

A strange voice is with him, in the void of his trance. It offers him his life, but in return he must undertake a mission. The voice reveals itself to be Eccothief, the soul of the powerful magical sentient sword which is currently impaled on the young man's heart. The weapon wishes freedom from this demonic master. 

As the young man accepts, the sword leaves a mystical metallic splint within his heart. The young man awakens hours later in the ashes of the violent invasion. He has a mighty scar across his chest, new powers at his fingertips, and he can vaguely feel the direction of the sword when he touches the scar with his hand.

+2 Heart  
+1 Force

## Say "pretty Please"
Any time you attempt to get someone to _do_ something for you, you get +1 to Effect.

If you need an NPC to guide you somewhere, and you try to Convince or Coerce them, you might've had Limited Effect if they're not already scared of you... With this, you might instead have Standard Effect.

## Equipment
![[Standard Equipment List]]

#### As a Pusher, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- An alcoholic drink, as an attractive piece of leverage, or something to dull the Inner Fire.
- A woodchopper's axe. It looks brutal. It probably is, +1 [[Formidability]].
- A set of clothes that exudes status above your actual position.

#### Your GM might also allow you to have, which you do not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Discreet melee weapon which you describe, +2 [[Formidability]] in close range.
- Hidden yet simple melee weapon which you describe, +1 [[Formidability]] in close range.

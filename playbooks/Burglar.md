+2 [[Expertise]]  
+1 [[Guile]]

## Go Unnoticed and Incognito
When you attempt to remain unnoticed, you get +1 [[Effect]].

If, for instance, you attempt to prowl through a hallway with few hiding spots, it might be Limited [[Effect]] since the hiding conditions are poor. With this, you would really know how to work the shadows and camouflage yourself, gaining Standard [[Effect]]!

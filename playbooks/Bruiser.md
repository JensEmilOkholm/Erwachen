+2 [[Force]]  
+1 [[Vigil]]

## Brute Force
When using brute force you gain +1 [[Effect]].

If you attempt to lift a shut portcullis, you may have Limited [[Effect]] since youâ€™re supposed to use a mechanism which is outside your reach. With Brute Force, you would gain Standard [[Effect]] instead.
This does *not* affect combat.

## Equipment
![[Standard Equipment List]]

#### As a Bruiser, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A bandana to obscure one's identity.
- A Rope-ladder all rolled up. 
- Some bandages. They're mostly clean and can be used for first aid.

#### Your GM might also allow you to have, which you do not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Brutish melee weapon which you describe, +2 [[Formidability]] in close range.
- Simple armor, +1 [[Formidability]] in close range.

+2 [[Force]]  
+1 [[Vigil]]

## Authority
When wielding authority, you gain +1 [[Effect]].

If you attempt to enter a restricted area, you may have Limited [[Effect]] since the guardsman doesn't know who you are. With Authority, you would gain Standard [[Effect]] instead.

## Equipment
![[Standard Equipment List]]

#### As a Pikesman, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Arresting tools, including a badge of authority (your local law enforcement, or some organisation), as well as manacles.
- Spear, almost... It's more like a long reinforced stick with an arrowhead, +1 [[Formidability]].
- Some bandages. They're mostly clean and can be used for first aid.

#### Your GM might also allow you to have, which you do not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Brutish melee weapon which you describe, +2 [[Formidability]] in close range.
- Simple armor, +1 [[Formidability]] in close range.

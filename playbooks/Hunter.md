## Sniff 'em Out
Anytime you're searching for a living being or navigating or tracking, you gain +1 [[Effect]].

For instance, if you attempt to track a monster back to its layer, it might be to Limited [[Effect]], as it doesn’t really leave too many tracks. With this, you would know the hidden little signs to look for, and therefore gain Standard [[Effect]].

## Equipment
![[Standard Equipment List]]

#### As a Hunter, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A skinning knife and tools to extract the valuables of slain foes.
- A sling or a bow. In either case, they are of poor make but could still be of use. You have ammo, but you may run out as a Complication. It gives +1 [[Formidability]], but only when you’re at a distance.
- A camouflaged cloak, sewn together with leaves and sticks. This cloak is fitted for the season but works poorly indoors.

#### Your GM might also allow you to have, which you do not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Powerful ranged weapon which you describe, +2 [[Formidability]] at range.
- Protective travelling suit, +1 [[Formidability]] in close range.

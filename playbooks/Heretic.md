+2 Vigil  
+1 Heart

## Conduct an Inquisition
Any time you try to acquire hidden information, you gain +1 Effect.

For instance, if you’re using your senses to see whether someone is lying, it might normally be to Limited, or even None Effect if they’re good at it. With this, you would get Standard, or at least Limited Effect.

## Equipment
![[Standard Equipment List]]

#### As a Heretic, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A handful of sleeping powder to blow in someone's face!
- A profane fetish, or unholy symbol. It will scare the god-fearing or earn you the respect of those who reject the common pantheon.
- A musical instrument, and you know how to play it too!

#### Your GM might also allow you to have, which you do not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Effective melee weapon which you describe, +2 [[Formidability]] in close range.
- Ceremonial, or hidden melee weapon which you describe, +1 [[Formidability]] in close range.

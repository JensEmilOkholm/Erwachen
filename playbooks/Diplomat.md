+2 [[Heart]]
+1 [[Guile]]

## Arbiter of Peace
When you attempt to talk someone out of violence, you get +1 [[Effect]].

If, for instance, you attempt to convince the Orcs to live and let live, it might be None [[Effect]] since the Orcs are wild and tribal. With this, you would know their customs well enough to gain Limited [[Effect]]!

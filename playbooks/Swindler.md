+2 [[Guile]]  
+1 [[Heart]]

## Strike 'em a Deal
Any time you try to sell something, or tell a lie, you gain +1 to [[Effect]].

If you try to sell ore at a higher rate than usual, you might otherwise have gotten Limited Effect, but with this, you might instead have Standard Effect.

## Equipment
![[Standard Equipment List]]

#### As a Swindler, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- An alcoholic drink, as an attractive piece of leverage, or something to dull the Inner Fire.
- A forged document, or seal, that will fool the casual observer.
- A valuable-looking but ultimately worthless piece of jewelry.

#### Your GM might also allow you to have, which you do not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Elegant melee weapon which you describe, +2 [[Formidability]] in close range.
- Simple ranged weapon which you describe, +1 [[Formidability]] at range.

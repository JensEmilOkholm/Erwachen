*The gods are thirsty. Not for faith, but for the perception of true reality.*

*They are stupid, mindless things that drink, and our minds be their cup!*

*They drink our grief, and our joy. They drink the satisfaction of our lives, of tilled soil, of keen hunts and harmony with nature. They drink our summer, our winter and all seasons change. They drink our songs, our music and all the noise that we hear. They drink what we build, and create and they drink what we see. They drink our fear, our courage and they drink our war. They drink our secrets, our ignorance and our knowledge. They drink our country, our trust and its end. They drink all deeds and all guilt. They drink as they always have, as they always will. For so long as we live, we are destined to be their wine.*

### Symbols:

- Eye
- Book
- A stylized cloak-and dagger design
- A Chalice (connected to a mythological "Wine of a Thousand Scholars")

### Appearance:

- To depict Whispers is heretical, for it implies Whispers can be seen and discearned. Most works of art featuring Whispers instead focus on hiding strange details in the piece
- Example: A painting features a happy family at an idyllic farm. Traces and hidden clues around the painting reveal some dark secret (infidelity, murder etc etc) Perhaps etched into the wood of the doorframe in the background is a little eye as well. This is considered a piece of art devoted to Whispers.
- There is a lot of recongizable Whispers art around libraries and places of knowledge, many of which feature quills, eyes and quotes from popular writings.

- Discovery and pursuit of knowledge feeds Whispers, but total discovery leads to stagnation. The god thus prefer slowly unraveling mysteries, and particularly when they lead to more questions.

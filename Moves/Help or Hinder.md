When you Help or Hinder, you must describe how it is possible and how you do it. 

This Move is only relevant if your method does not guarantee success or failure. For instance, you might Hinder someone who is running by tripping them. You might help someone by grabbing hold of the large heavy object they are trying to carry. This move is *not* relevant if you "Hinder" someone by making their task impossible, or "Help" someone by making their task impossible to fail.

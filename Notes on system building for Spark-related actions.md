In order to craft a system that allows for a truly customizable "spark" here are things to do:

- Write 2 basic actions, per powerlevel, for 
	- Primalism
	- Miraclework
	- Sorcery
	- Wizardry
	- Occultism
	- Psychics
- Write a cast of generic components.
- Give each components some lenient requirements.

So actions have a requirement, and then it can be learned. It will tell you how to finish its own description. Example:

### Empowered Fighting
Requires Primalism 1.
You adopt a fighting style which increases your [[Formidability]] by your Potency value.
When you get this move initially, pick 2 **components** that you have access to. Describe how your move looks:


And then somewhere else in the rules you would have components like...

**Meaningful lightsource**
Requires Miraclework 1 or Sorcery 1
Your move creates a meaningful light source, about as useful as a torch. 

**Elemental hazard**
Requires Primalism 1 or Sorcery 1
Your move gains an elemental hazard of your choosing. Pick between: *Fire*, *Water*, *Air,* *Earth*, etc.

**Incredibly loud**
Requires Primalism 1 or Psychics 1
Your move makes a lot of noise.

**Silent**
Requires Sorcery 2 or Occultism 1 or Psychics 1
Your move is completely silent.

**Scary**
Requires Occultism 1 or Psychics 2
Your move is unnerving or downright terrifying to behold. It may be aggressively uncanny, or downright grotesque.

**Defensive**
Requires Primalism 2
Any damage you take while performing this move is decreased by 1.

**Awe**
Requires Miraclework 1 or Psychics 1
Forces others to turn their attention towards you. This affects only those you mean for it to affect.

**Obscure**
Requires Sorcery 2 or Psychics 1
Your move is particularly uninteresting.

**Destructive**
Requires Primalism 2 or Sorcery 3
Your move is capable of breaking through hard materials like stone or steel.

**Formidable**
Requires Primalism 4
While performing the move, and in the immediate moment after the move, increase your [[Formidability]] by 1.

### Example: Jerry's Holy Warrior
Jerry is making a spark for his holy warrior. He might pick Primalism and have Empowered Fighting. He also has at least 2 Miraclework for the holy warrior. He wants the move to grab the enemies attention, so his allies can fight more freely. Jerry describes that when the character fights, a glowing halo appear above their head, and the holy light compels the enemies to suffer the wrath of the crusader!

Jerry picks Meaningful light source, and Awe as their components. When the warrior meets an opponent in battle, they become an avatar of holy wrath. Their eyes glows yellowish and a glowing halo appear above their head. The GM will turn the monsters attention on the holy warrior.

The player doesn't have Primalism 2, or they might've picked Defensive. That is alright, though. With Miraclework 2, they might just have another move or two up their sleeve to help them survive.

### Example: Tina's Tooth and Claw
This is an example where the GM and the Player must workshop something new, using the guiding principles. For generic examples, see Jerry's Holy Warrior, and Martins Berserker.
Tina is making a spark for her own fighting character. Her idea is that her character doesn't use weapons but instead metamorphs animalistic weapons, like fangs and claws. This fighting style will use Empowered Fighting, but that only gives 1 Formidability, and Tina is giving up on weapons which ordinarily would mean giving up on bonus from gear and mastery.

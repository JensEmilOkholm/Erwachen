When creating a custom Archetype, make at least as many [[Origins]] as you have players. These [[Origins]] need to cover a diverse cast, so ensure each Origin is varied from one another. Generally, there are only three steps to creating an origin, but before you can complete these steps it is important to consider what sort of Origin you are creatin

## Step 1, Archetype theme:
The first thing you need to work out, as a group, is a good theme for your Archetype. This will help define what your whole game will be about, and is in many ways the single most important decision to make before the game starts. The theme that you choose here, should be the theme you want to emphasize and really consider *main* theme of your game. Your theme could be anything, and it could even combine multiple themes. A few examples could be:
- Warfare
- Exploration
- Pioneering
- Base building
- Investigation
- Discovery
- Heroism
- Opportunism
- Desparation
- Crime
- Order

## Step 2, Archetype name:
Let us say that our group has decided to go with themes of exploration and discovery. By now, our group would specify a proper title for our Archetype. This will define, more directly, the thing that connects us all and sends us off on an adventure. A good title is specific enough that everyone know what "types" of people would beling to the Archetype, but also flexible enough to make unique Origins for all players. For exploration and discovery, perhaps our group has chosen **Treasure Hunter**!

## Step 3, Archetype Origins:
Make at least an Origin for each player that will participate in the game. The procedure for creating an origin follows below.

# Custom Origin
### Step 1, Origin concept:
Consider what role your Origin should fulfill. Then, find out how that role can work within the setting, and the Archetype. Finally, come up with a name for the Origin. At this point it is especially important to collaborate with the players of the group, to ensure that the Origins are all varied from each other, so as to not fulfill the same role as someone else in the group. As an example, we might want a worldly and knowledgable old traveling companion. Well, the Archetype title is **Treasure Hunter**. Then perhaps your Origin could lean into the nerdy archaological side of treasure hunting. Your Origin might then become "Historian" or even just "Archeologist". To extend the example, let us say a fellow player was contemplating that their Origin should be "Academic". This fulfills a rather similar role, but luckily that other player was not too invested and quickly decided that they would instead be the "Expedition Guide".

### Step 2, Core Attribute Score:
One [[Core Attribute Score]] is increased by 2, and one is increased by 1. Consider carefully what the attribute scores actually do, and make your combination. The Archeologist is a passionate and knowledgable professional, so we might pick Expertise 2, and Heart 1. Our friendly Expedition Guide nods eargerly and informs us that they will pick Vigil 2 and Guile 1, as they are used to navigating dangerous woodlands. 

### Step 3, Origin move:
Then you get a unique Move. These [[Moves]] generally either increases your [[Effect]], or safens your [[Position]] when you do something specific. As an archeologist, we probably want to have a higher [[Effect]] when recalling historical knowledge. Our friend, the Guide, then informs us that they would like to be able to have a safer [[Position]] when scouting ahead in the wilds.

### Step 4, Origin equipment:
Finally each origin get a few pieces of equipment. They have all the typical starting equipment. Then you must pick 3 pieces of equipment from the mundane part of the [[Variant Equipment List]], and then a set of weapons and armor. Depending on the tone of the game, your group may decide to start without weapons and armor. This can lead to a game where you must rise from the dirt and mud. As an Archeologist, we want to be able to whip out X and X and X. Meanwhile the Guide will want to pack a Y and a Y and also a Y.

Safe - There is no real consequence for failure.

Risky - There is some form of consequence for failure, but you could salvage the outcome… You might not escape without some Damage or a burn from your Inner Fire. (1-3 points).

Perilous - Failure is dangerous. You risk taking some serious Damage, or burst your Inner Fire. (4-6 points).

Lethal - Failure could be the end of your journey, or at least take you down. You might also be consumed by your Inner Fire (7+ points)

Keep in mind that the consequences for failure doesn’t always have to be damage. It is also worth noting that Accomplishing should generally carry milder consequences compared to Failing, while Excelling typically carry no consequences at all. To put that in to damage numbers, Accomplishing with a Risky Position, would mean you take 1 or 2 damage while Failing would be more along the lines of 2 or 3 damage.

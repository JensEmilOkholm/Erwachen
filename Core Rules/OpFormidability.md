When players engage in violent confrontations, they compare their [[Formidability]] with that of their opponents. This means the GM must determine the Oppositions Formidability, or OPFOR. As a rule of thumb for humanoid enemies, OPFOR can be determined in a similar way that normal players determine theirs.

Most opposition has a starting Formidability of 2.

A primitive weapon will typically give +1 Formidability, while a proper weapon gives +2. Light armor will also give +1, while heavy armor gives +2.

Being proficient with your weapon, yields another +1, and an expert with their weapon may add +2.

Those with the Spark may use the action Flare of Power, to take 3 Inner Fire in order to raise their Formidability for a Scene.

This means that a dangerous orcish warrior armed to the teeth may well be formidability 6. They have weapons, light armor and they know how to use those blades. 
2 (from base) + 2 (from armed) + 1 (from armor) + 1 (from proficient) = 6

It is to be noted that a GM needs no excuse to give enemies a penalty or bonus, if they feel it is better for the narrative.

When opposition team up, use this procedure to find their OPFOR.
- Take the most Formidable member, as base Formidability.
- Determine if the opposition are Horde, Normal or Elite monsters.
	- Horde monsters add 1 per team-up
	- Normal monsters add 2 per team-up
	- Elite monsters add 3 per team-up

## Example: Bref the tall Knight
Billy's Player Character, Bref, is a tall knight with the spark. He wears heavy armor, has a beautiful steel sword and he knows how to use it.  This means that Bref normally fights with a Formidability of 7 (2 base, 2 armor, 2 weapon, 1 proficiency). Bref has Empowered Fighting, as his spark leans into Primalism. This gives him a Formidability of 8. If he really needs to, he might use Flare of Power and briefly gain another Formidability so that he has 9.

A pseudo-goblin with a base Formidability of 2, and + 1 for the shovel-axe it is waving around over its head has an OPFOR of 3. It is not very dangerous on its own. However, if it is joined by 4 of its mates, the OPFOR becomes 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7, since they are a Horde monster. So 5 of these little monsters are an even match for Bref the Knight, without his Empowered Fighting.

A goblin foot-soldier might have a scrap-metal sword and something resembling armor. The GM determines that they will run the goblins as Formidability 4, even though, strictly, the math says 5 (base 2, weapon 1, armor 1, skill 1). The GM chooses to do this because the players should feel that these soldiers are a form of cannon-fodder. The GM doesn't need any excuse to do this, but if they want to justify themselves they can always say that the soldiers education in swordplay is lackluster and that the weapon is of terrible quality. Perhaps that weapon is rusty or dull. If the goblin foot-soldier is joined by 2 of its mates, the math becomes 4 + 2 + 2 = 8, since this enemy is Normal, meaning 3 of these together pose a much greater threat. So 3 goblin footsoldiers are an even match for Bref when he uses his Empowered Fighting.

Similarly, a mighty orcish warrior with an OPFOR of 6, when joined by a single battle-brother, gets a total OPFOR of 6 + 3 = 9, since they are Elite. These tall and skillful warriors are to be taken serious indeed. These are an even match if Bref uses Flare of Power for a momentary increase in Formidability.

### Example: Matilda the Shieldmaiden
Matilda the shieldmaiden is clad in agile but well-crafted armor and wields a round wooden shield and a long straight sword. She is a badass that knows how to use that weapon through the rigerous training of her clan warfare. With a base of 2 [[Formidability]], advanced weapons (+2) and armor (+2) not to mention her keen ability (+2) she has a [[Formidability]] of 8. At the end of her great adventure, she has a mighty spark that allows her to fight with a [[Formidability]] of 10, and that's without using the Flare of Power to raise her [[Formidability]] all the way up to 12.

At her best, she is an even match for 3 Elite orchish warriors (6 + 3 + 3 = 12), or as many as 5 of the goblin foot-soldiers (4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2=12). For the Pseudo-goblins to match her, they'd have to team up 10 of them (3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12).

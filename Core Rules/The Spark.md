The Spark is a rare and mystical force that ignites in a soul full of hope. It is a metaphysical essence that grants extraordinary abilities, allowing its bearers to perform feats beyond the reach of ordinary people. It is the very foundation of all magic. Whether manifesting as raw magical power or enhancing physical prowess, the Spark is both a gift and a mystery. Those without the Spark cannot channel magic from within themselves. It cannot be sought out or claimed by desire alone; it awakens within those of exceptional willpower, strange dispositions, or even ones that are chosen by gods or other immortal beings.

In Erwachen, players have the opportunity to create a unique Spark of their own. This may be a part of character creation, or it may come a little ways into the story. 

If you wish to play a game where characters must rise from the dust and the mud to earn their status as great heroes, then you will have played several sessions of harsh survival after which something dramatic happens that leads your character awaken to their Spark.

If you wish to play a game of classical Heroic Fantasy, then you should work your Sparks awakening into the background stories of your characters. Alternatively, you could play a single session, which culminates in the creation of a Spark.

# Spark Creation
Each spark is a balance between the schools of magic:
- Primalism
- Miraclework
- Sorcery
- True Wizardry
- Occultism
- Psychics
Each spark also has a Potency.

A Spark is notated by 7 numbers and a set of [[Moves]]. The numbers are attributes for Potency and the 6 schools of magic. When you get the Spark, a few standard [[Moves]] accompany it. Everyone gains these. Then a few more are added as you craft your unique version of the Spark.

Higher levels within a school of magic unlocks the potential for more advanced forms of magic. These are not necessarily more powerful, just more advanced. The raw power of your abilities comes from your Potency.

- When you start out, your Potency is 1

- Then choose one school of magic to start with a score of 2, and one school of magic to start with a score of 1. You may not pick True Wizardry at character creation.

- Then pick three [[Moves]] that you meet the requirements for, from the list of Spark [[Moves]] in the [[Moves]] chapter.

*If you wish to*, you may forego starting one school at 2, and instead start at Potency 2. In this case, your Potency is 2, and you pick a single school of magic to start with a score of 1. In this case, you only get one move from the list of Spark [[Moves]]. This makes your spark less versatile, but more potent at its base level. 

On a character sheet this is represented like so:

**Note on how to advance your Potency:**
1 Potency block is filled out.
1 Potency block *can* be filled out called the "Focus Block". If a player chooses to opt for a starting potency of 2 and just 1 power, they fill the "Focus Block".
Otherwise, every new power acquired, makes you fill one-half potency block. That way you gain another potency every other power you acquire.
So Starting Potency: Long square always filled
Then Focus Block: Long square *sometimes filled*
Finally for advancement: Several blocks half the size of the starting blocks, paired up in twos. Filling a pair gets you another Potency.

## Primalism
The power of the body. Most primalists move faster and punch harder. Many make raw blasts of kinetic energy in the air. Certain primalists enhance their senses, or sharpen their instincts. Primalism is the form of magic most suited to affecting your own body.

## Miraclework
The power of faith. The miracleworker might cure a disease, light your way in the dark, or remain unharmed when burned on a pyre.

## Sorcery
The power of the arcane. A sorcerer knows incantations gestures and rituals. Enough to cast an elaborate spell, and change the circumstances of their surroundings significantly. A fundamental rule of Sorcery, is that it cannot directly affect and change biological beings.

## True Wizardry
The power of tools and implements. A wizard uses magical objects and tools to achieve predetermined effects. They might carry a staff or wand that shoots precise and powerful darts of fire. They might be the proud owner of a magic helmet that let you see people's soul. This is the only type of magic available to those without the spark, but *with* the spark, you become a True Wizard. True Wizardry is the art of weaving one's own power into the effects of an implement. It can be tremendously powerful, but remains dependent on physical objects. True Wizardry can only be advanced in if you already wield Wizardry. As such, it cannot be picked at character creation. If your Spark ignites during a game where a piece of wizardry has already been acquired, you may ignite a spark with points in True Wizardry.

## Occultism
The power that lies beyond mortal ken. These are abilities taught by demons, or angels or something else entirely. The teacher does not power the abilities, the users own spark does, but the abilities cannot be taught by other mortals. The witch who summoned a devil for magic is an Occultist, as is the shaman that petition mystical spirits for favors.

## Psychics
The power of the mind. The psychic expert can send telepathic messages across great lengths. They can dominate the will of others. They may see what is unseen, or hear what has no sound.

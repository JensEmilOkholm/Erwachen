In Erwachen, origins are a starting point for characters. It does not define how you advance, only how you start. 

The anatomy of an origin is simple enough: 
- One [[Core Attribute Score]] is increased by 2, and one is increased by 1.

- Then you get a unique Move. These [[Moves]] generally either increases your [[Effect]], or safens your [[Position]] when you do something specific.

- Finally each origin get a few pieces of equipment. Generally, they have available all typical starting equipment, 3 pieces of equipment that is unique to the origin, and then a set of weapons and armor. Depending on the tone of the game, your group may decide to start without weapons and armor.


# Origin Archetypes
Origins come in archetypical categories, which you may see as a "set" of origins. The archetype should have a descriptive title as well as 4-6 origins, at least as many origins as there are players.

The purpose of these sets, is to be able to play a game where everyone starts out as a common archetype. Perhaps everyone are criminals. Perhaps everyone are nobles, or merchants or even just professionals. Archetypes are possible, due to the simple nature of origins in Erwachen. As described above, they are only a starting point and do not include anything beyond what is described as the anatomy of an origin. Therefore, creating new origins is rather simple, and a guide to doing so can be found in [[Custom Archetype]].

Normally, all players pick an origin from within the same Archetype. It is expected that origins from the same Archetype are different, but also that origins from two different Archetypes may be incredibly similar. For instance, in the **Criminal** Archetype, the [[Poacher]] is unique among **Criminal** origins, but very similar to the [[Hunter]] origin in the **Common worker** Archetype. That said, if players and GMs all agree that some mixing is okay, then *okay it is!* 

Players and GM's can easily come up with a new Archetype, if they wish to. This can be done as a part of group character creation. The provided origins, are fully realized, but they are also examples that can be used for inspiration. So if your group wish to come up with another archetype, see [[Custom Archetype]] for instructions on how to correctly make up a set of origins!

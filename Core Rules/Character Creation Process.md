## Step 1, Archetype:
Decide between all participants which Archetype to use. The game comes with **Criminal** and **Common worker** ready to use, but you can also make a [[Custom Archetype]] as part of your group character creation.

## Step 2, Concept:
Make a concept.

## Step 3, Species:
Take a [[Species]].

## Step 4, Origin:
Take an [Origin](Origins.md).

## Step 5, Core Attribute Score:
Your [Origin](Origins.md) affects 2 out of the 5 [[Core Attribute Score]]s. 
Of those *not* affected, pick a [[Core Attribute Score]] to become 1.
Of those *not* affected, pick a [[Core Attribute Score]] to become 0.
Of those *not* affected, pick a [[Core Attribute Score]] to become -1.

## Step 6, Thresholds:
You start with 5 in both Thresholds. Your [[Species]] will modify this.
You may add +1 to either of the two Thresholds.

## Step 7, Formidability
Note your Formidability as 2.

## Step 8, The Spark:
If you start with [[The Spark]], go to spark-creation now.

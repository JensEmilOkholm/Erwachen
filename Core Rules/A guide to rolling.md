When you are asked to roll+[[Core Attribute Score]], you roll 2d6 and add the value of your score.

Before you roll, though, you will be given a [[Position]] and an [[Effect]]. All outcomes will be seen in light of your [[Position]] and [[Effect]]. Unless otherwise stated by the GM, you may also decide not to do the Move afterall, once you know your [[Position]] and [[Effect]]. The GM might decide that the action is moving too quick for your character to reconsider, but in most situations, a character can abstain from an action they deem unwise.

Your result is:  
1-6: You fail to accomplish what you meant to. Unless the [[Position]] was Safe, expect something unfavourable to happen. This is called Fail.

7-9: You accomplish what you meant to, but some complications occur. This is called Accomplish.

10+: You get the best possible results. Note that your [[Effect]] informs what the best _possible_ result is. This is called Excel.

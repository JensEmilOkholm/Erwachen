A character’s Formidability score is used to determine their base [[Position]] and [[Effect]] when fighting. The Position and Effect can be affected circumstantially, and this can be more important than a characters Formidability, in some cases.

If a character has the same Formidability as their enemy, they fight at a Perilous [[Position]], to a Standard [[Effect]].

When one is ahead of the other, they may affect the player’s [[Effect]] and [[Position]] as such:

- If you are one point ahead, your Effect becomes Great, **or** your Position becomes Risky.
    
- If you are two points ahead, your Effect becomes Great, **and** your Position becomes Risky.
    
- If you are three points ahead, your Effect becomes Great, and your Position becomes Safe. There is normally no need to roll dice, if you are three points ahead.
    
- If you are one point behind, your Effect becomes Limited, while your Position remains Perilous.
    
- If you are two points behind, your Effect becomes None, and your Position remains Perilous.
    

All Player Characters have a starting Formidability of 2.

A primitive weapon will typically give +1 Formidability, while a proper weapon gives +2. Light armor will also give +1, while heavy armor gives +2.

Being proficient with your weapon, yields another +1, and an expert with their weapon may add +2.

Those with the Spark may use the action Flare of Power, to take 3 Inner Fire in order to raise their Formidability for a Scene.

The Spark might also offer other ways to increase ones Formidability.

**Note:**
The meaning of different levels of Effect can sometimes vary, based on the narrative of the situation. Say that you have Standard Effect, and you want to take your opponent alive. Well this might be difficult because you only just have the potential to win the duel if you give it your all. Therefore, the opponent die when you win, which is not quite what you wanted. If you can increase your Formidability and get Great Effect, you can say that you want to make them surrender and you can take them alive. 

On the other hand, if you actually want them dead, but you have Standard Effect, the narrative can go the other way; You might be able to defeat them if you win, but you won't be able to prevent them escaping the situation alive. If you can increase your Formidability and get Great Effect, you can say that you want to deliver a killing blow when you win.

It is up to the player and the GM to determine what constitutes Limited, Standard, and Great Effects. The GM has final say.

### Example: Matilda the shieldmaiden
Matilda the shieldmaiden is clad in agile but well-crafted armor and wields a round wooden shield and a long straight sword. She is a badass that knows how to use that weapon through the rigerous training of her clan warfare. With a base of 2 [[Formidability]], advanced weapons (+2) and armor (+2) not to mention her keen ability (+2) she has a [[Formidability]] of 8. At the end of her great adventure, she has a mighty spark that allows her to fight with a [[Formidability]] of 10, and that's without using the Flare of Power to raise her [[Formidability]] all the way up to 12.

[[Inner Fire threshold]] -1

Lucky: Once per day, when you don't like your roll, you may reroll it. You keep the new result regardless of whether it was an improvement.

Very Lucky: Once per day, when you pass your [[Damage Threshold]], you instead take enough [[Damage]] to be one point from [[Damage Threshold]].



*People of different species cannot procreate with each other, save for dwarven women. Dwarven women can carry the children of Men, Elves, Deeplings and, of course, Dwarves. A union of dwarf and non-dwarf is known as a halfling, or half-dwarf. Their Sire determine which type of halfling they become. Halflings may only procreate with other halflings of the same type.*

*The Heartlander know agriculture like no other people. They love things that grow, and things that make them safe and at home. A phenomena known as Wanderlust, with a capital W, sometimes overtake the heart of a Heartlander and they find themselves wandering off on an adventure. They are the union of men and dwarves*

[[Damage Threshold]] +1  
[[Inner Fire threshold]] -1

Once per phase, when you pass your [[Damage Threshold]], you instead take enough [[Damage]] to be one point from [[Damage Threshold]].

Your dwarven nose allows you to rely on your sense of smell at an increased level of [[Effect]].

*In their Khaz, or City-Under-the-Mountain, mighty dwarves mine for precious resources. They build industrious solutions to their strange living terms. The typical dwarf may live nearly two centuries.*

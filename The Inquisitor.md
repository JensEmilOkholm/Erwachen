He came to the village on foot, though we all later agreed he must have ridden and left his horse somewhere nearby. Otherwise he could not have arrived so soon after our messenger left. I noticed his hat first. The silver star of the Inquisition, buttoned in the front of the hat, caught some light and it shone briefly, before the rim of the hat came through the cold humid fog. The hat was of dark leather, top bent backwards and ending in a point. The rim was wide enough to obscure the inquisitor's face so long as he angled it slightly down, showing instead etched runes upon the rim. I couldn't read them in the fog, but I imagined they were a declaration of faith in The Judge. On the side of the hat, tucked into a buckle, was a large raven feather, which seemed oddly unaffected by the drizzle and the fog.

The man was clad in a long coat of thick and heavy looking leather, black as coal and oddly dry despite the fog, same as the raven feather. His boots neared his knees, and the silk shirt contrasted the dark leather by being white and surprisingly clean looking for a man that had been on the road. I assumed he had ridden with the coat shut and only just opened it for a spot of ice cold and wet air.

He strode into town confidently, ignoring the starts and stares of villagers who scrambled to get out of his way. Once he had come into the town proper he stopped, and let his gaze slide in a wide arch, slowly and methodically, across town. Finally he turned sharply towards the little porch where I was sitting next to the alderman. To my discomfort, his eyes seemed to land on me before the alderman, and he gave a subtle polite nod. Then he marched up to the alderman and finally spoke. His voice was dry and impatient.

"Provide me with all documentation of the town layout, living arrangements and businesses."

Knowing Thorben as I did, I expected him to jump with obedience, but astonishingly, he made the Inquisitor wait. He met the stern strangers gaze, with inscrutable expression, and slowly explained that this would take time to produce. That the town was not as well documented as the Inquisitor would no doubt wish. That the Inquisitor could have an overview over the 3 local businesses, but that their expenses and earnings would only be available if the businesses themselves had effective book-keeping. He told the inquisitor, unhurriedly, that the living arrangements of the town were people's own business and that such things were not commited to paper.

That was the first time I had known Thorben to lie. I wondered why. I wondered if I aught call him out. We had all agreed to summon the Inquisitor, why would Thorben lie just to impede the investigation? Why, Thorben and I had archived some of the documents that the Inquisitor was asking about just last night!

Why would I *trust* Thorben when *trust* is in such short supply that we have had to summon an Inquisitor?

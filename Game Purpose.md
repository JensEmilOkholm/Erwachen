I am making this game in order to entertain myself and my friends. The goal-post is to design something that combines the beauty and simplicity of Powered by the Apocalypse, and Forged in the Dark principles, with a single flagship mechanic of mine called "The Spark". The Spark is how players forge a unique and highly customizable fantasy hero without having to label themselves with a classic "Class". 

I consider this game succesful, if players experience that the game engine at its core is simple to understand and use. The quickest way to explain that simple core principle is thus: 

When you make a move, you will be told what you stand to gain, and what you stand to lose. You will then roll 2d6+some ability score. 1-6 gives you a bad result, 7-9 gives you a result that makes you succeed but with some narrative complication or consequence, and 10+ gives you a result that makes you look really cool.

Legal disclaimer:
This game is designed by me for myself. It is open source, non-profit, just something I've written and that's it. There is no commercial element. There is no hidden commercial element. It is *just* for fun.
